## POC to implement an automated tag/release cycle, based on PR labels

POC to implement an automated tag/release cycle, based on PR labels.

Uses:

- [Release Drafter Action](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter): Drafts your next release notes as pull requests are merged into the main branch. Built with Probot.
- [Version Drafter Action](https://github.com/patrickjahns/version-drafter-action): GitHub Action designed as companion for release-drafter to determine the next semantic version based on the github labels of merged pull requests.
- [PR Labeler](https://github.com/srvaroa/labeler): Implements a GitHub Action that labels Pull Requests based on configurable conditions.
